# 🧠 RAGForge – Retrieval-Augmented Generation Experiments

This repository showcases different approaches to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and includes a simple **Flask application** for serving the models.  
The goal of this project is to explore various vector search methods, embedding strategies, and model integrations to enhance question-answering systems.

## 📂 Repository Structure & Descriptions

### 1. `flask_rag_app/`
A Flask-based web application that provides an interface to interact with the RAG pipelines.  
It is designed to take user queries, retrieve relevant context from stored documents, and generate responses using the selected backend model.

---

### 2. `RAG_with_CS.ipynb`
Implementation of **RAG with Cosine Similarity**.  
- Uses document embeddings.  
- Retrieves the most relevant context based on cosine similarity scores.  
- Demonstrates a lightweight retrieval mechanism without specialized vector databases.  

---

### 3. `RAG_with_HuggingFace_Ollama_WeaviateDB.ipynb`
Implementation of **RAG with HuggingFace + Ollama + WeaviateDB**.  
- Uses **HuggingFace** models for embeddings.  
- Stores and retrieves vectors with **WeaviateDB** for scalable similarity search.  
- Generates responses using **Ollama** with context from Weaviate.  
- Suitable for large datasets with metadata filtering and hybrid search.

---

### 4. `RAG_with_HuggingFace_Ollama_FAISS.ipynb`
Implementation of **RAG with HuggingFace + Ollama + FAISS**.  
- Combines **HuggingFace Transformers** for embedding generation.  
- Uses **Ollama** as the language model for response generation.  
- Relies on **FAISS** for scalable vector similarity search.  
- Provides a hybrid setup leveraging both HuggingFace and Ollama capabilities.  

---

### 5. `.gitignore`
Specifies files and directories to be excluded from version control, such as temporary files, environment settings, and cache data.

## 🎯 Key Highlights

- Multiple RAG implementations with different similarity and embedding backends.  
- Comparison between **cosine similarity**, **FAISS-based retrieval**, and **hybrid approaches**.  
- Integration of **Flask** to provide a lightweight, interactive way to test RAG pipelines.  
- Modular structure for experimenting with different retrieval and generation strategies.
